# Contribution Guide

## Development Dependencies

Install dependencies for testing using bundler:
```shell
bundle install --with test
```

## Running the Tests

Run the tests using:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

This tests Capistrano 3 functionality, without using Bugsnag to make the deployment call.  To test Capistrano 2 functionality set the environment variable `CAP_2_TEST` to `true` and re-install and run the tests.

In order to test using the main Bugsnag notifier to send the deployment notification, include the group `bugsnag` in the install command:
```shell
bundle install --with test bugsnag
```
